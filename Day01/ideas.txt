# 💡 My Top 3 Scripting Goals (Target: Day 24)

Based on Day 1 Video, here are 3 projects I want to master:

1. **System Health Monitor**: 
   - Script to check Disk Usage (>80%) and RAM usage (>80%).
   - Trigger an alert (email/echo) if critical.

2. **Log Cleaner & Archiver**:
   - Find logs older than 7 days.
   - Compress them (`tar`) and move them to a backup folder.

3. **Multi-Server Connectivity Checker**:
   - Loop through a list of server IPs.
   - Ping them and report which ones are DOWN.
