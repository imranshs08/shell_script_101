What is Shell Script ?

A shell script is a file that contains a series of commands that are executed by a shell (a program that interprets and executes commands). 

Shell scripts are used to automate tasks and automate repetitive tasks.

Types of Shell Script :

   - Interactive Shell script / Command Line Interface (CLI)
   - Non-Interactive Shell Script / Batch Script

cat /etc/shells 


What is Shebang in Linux Shell Scripting ?

Shebang is a special line at the beginning of a shell script that tells the system which interpreter to use to execute the script. 

Shebang line is also known as hashbang or pound bang or hashpling.

Example:
   #!/bin/bash


#!/bin/bash

# Simple script to display system information
echo "Hello, $USER!"
echo "Today is: $(date)"
echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"


How to Give Permission and Run a Shell Script:

1. Add Execution Permission:
   chmod +x script_name.sh

2. Run the Script:
   ./script_name.sh

   OR

   bash script_name.sh
